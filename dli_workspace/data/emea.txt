EMEA is a shorthand designation meaning Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The acronym is used by institutions and governments, as well as in marketing and business when referring to this region it is a shorthand way of referencing the two continents ( Africa and Europe ) and the Middle Eastern sub-continent all at once. There are roughly 115 countries and 17 non-country territories in the EMEA, but that number is not definitive.
